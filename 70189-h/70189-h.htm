</div>

<p class="dropcap">When Shelley wrote <span class="smcap">The Sensitive Plant</span> he
was drawing very near the end of his poetry.
It was one of the poems belonging to the
days at Pisa, whither the Shelleys had gone
late in the January of 1820. In the next
winter—a winter of many painful associations for him, and many
discouragements and reminders of evil fortune—he wrote this
mysterious song of beauty and death. The idea of it appears to
have come to him from the flowers which Mrs. Shelley had
collected round her in her own room at the house they occupied
on the south side of the Arno. Their fragrance, as it exhaled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
on the wintry Italian sunshine, and the sense of their fading
loveliness, added to certain graver influences of which we read,—the
death of a dearly-loved child, the illness of a dear friend,—contributed,
no doubt, to provide that “atmosphere of memorial
dejection and very sorrowful delight,” of which an old Italian
poet speaks, as being propitious for the working of the imagination.
But a miracle is not less miraculous because we know the
conditions under which it was worked, and something inexplicable
remains about <span class="smcap">The Sensitive Plant</span> after we have gathered
together everything we can of its circumstances and the
moods of its poet in the memorable Pisan days when it was
written.</p>

<p>All through this period, so far as we can gather, Shelley was
extremely discouraged about his poetry and the reception it had
attained hitherto. From Medwin and others we learn of the
special resentment he felt at the continual hostilities of the
powerful quarterly engines of critical opinion. In a letter to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Ollier, he said, during 1820: “I doubt whether I shall write
more. I could be content either with the hell or the paradise of
poetry, but the torments of its purgatory vex me without exciting
my powers sufficiently to put an end to the vexation.” However,
when a poet of Shelley’s plenary inspiration decides not to write,
he is likely to be impelled most strongly by his <i>dæmon</i> to new
flights. The “Ode to a Skylark,” the “Witch of Atlas,” the
“Ode to Liberty,” among other poems, belong to this period;
and with them we have the invincible declaration of the poet’s
rights and inalienable liberties, to be found in his prose “Defence
of Poetry.” One or two stanzas there are in the “Witch of
Atlas,” and one or two passages in the “Defence,” which strike
us as being more intimately connected with the occult imaginative
origins of <span class="smcap">The Sensitive Plant</span> than anything found elsewhere
in his writings. Take the strange, melodious verses in
which the radiant creature of the mountains is presented,—the
lovely lady garmented in the light of her own beauty, to whom the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
camelopard and the brindled lioness, the herdsmen and the mountain
maidens came:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>For she was beautiful: her beauty made</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The bright world dim, and everything beside</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>No thought of living spirit could abide</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>(Which to her looks had ever been betrayed)</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>On any object in the world so wide,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>On any hope within the circling skies,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>But in her form, and in her inmost eyes.</i></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="tb">* * * * *</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Were stored with magic treasures—sounds of air,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Which had the power all spirits of compelling,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Folded in cells of crystal silence there.</i>”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="tb">* * * * *</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>A few stanzas later, and we come to the idea of the strange
seed, which was wrapt in mould, and watered all the summer with
sweet dew. At length:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>The plant grew strong and green—the sunny flower</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>To turn the light and dew by inward power</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>To its own substance.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This brings us as near, I imagine, to the idea of <span class="smcap">The Sensitive
Plant</span> as we are likely to find ourselves in any other most
Shelleyan region of his poetry. The lines recur persistently to
the mind in reading the later poem; and almost as suggestively
is it haunted by one passage at least in the “Defence,” which
speaks with a sort of aerial eloquence of a Poetry whose art it is to
arrest “the vanishing apparitions which haunt the interlunations
of life, and veiling them, or in language or in form, sends them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
forth among mankind bearing sweet news of kindred joy to those
with whom their sisters abide.”</p>

<p>When one considers the rarity and the half-impalpable conditions
of this chosen realm of his poetry, and turns to <span class="smcap">The Sensitive
Plant</span> as one of its most essential expressions, one is at
first rendered half-incredulous of the power of a kindred art to
interpret effectively such a poem. But, in fact, there is a much
more concrete imagery—whether of flowers or weeds, directly
presented or definitely symbolised; or of the Lady who haunts
among them—than one at all remembers until one takes to
conning its stanzas closely with an eye to such effects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sensitive Plant</span> lends itself more readily to the art of
the symbolist, in particular, than any other of Shelley’s poems. It
would be quite possible for a critic with a turn for metaphysics,
and a certain German patience of analytic ingenuity, to read into
its exquisite fable of mortality a whole world of significance,
which the poet himself had never suspected. But the symbolic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
artist, if he be too, as needs be, a symbolic poet, is saved by his
art. The spirit of the poem is likely to obsess him, and compel
from him only such an interpretation as is, allowing for the casual
differences of kindred arts and sympathetic temperaments, truly
and finely accordant with its own essential qualities and terms
of expression. The true poets have that power of continuing
to enlarge the original issues and influences of their song long
after its immediate effect has died away. Shelley commands
with a more than usual lyric enchantment a sphere that, like
the magic house of Merlin, can go on enlarging itself; until one
figures him, not as the sad spirit of the garden in this poem, but
as the radiant spirit of his “Hymn of Apollo”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>All harmony of instrument or verse,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>All prophecy, all medicine are mine,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>All light of art or nature—to my song</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Victory and praise in their own right belong.</i>”</div>

<h2 class="nobreak">A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS</h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">In one sense a beautiful poem can never be
illustrated: being beautiful it is already perfect,
and, to intelligent minds, illustrates
itself. Everything that it says it says in the
best possible way; within the limits of the
medium chosen, it is absolute.</p>

<p>If, therefore, illustration is to be an attempt to say over again
what the poet has already said perfectly, it is certain to prove itself
superfluous, and to be nothing better than a labour of tautology.
But there is a quality in all fine work which gives invitation into
the charmed circle of its influence to whatever is freshly and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
sympathetically touched with the ideas it conveys. Great work
tells so differently on different minds; not by contrary but by
kindred ways it speaks freshly perhaps to each individual.</p>

<p>Thus, to express accurately in another medium an appreciation,
an individual sense of delight or emotion in work of finished and
constructive beauty is the only way of illustration which seems to
me profitable. The appreciation may be faulty; but in so far as
it states a personal view of its subject, it has legitimate standing
ground.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to make evident in my drawings the particular
way in which this poem has appealed to me. The garden,
fine and elaborate, full of artifice, opposing with an infinity of
delicate labour the random overgrowth of the wilderness which
seeks jealously to encroach on it, has perhaps this to hint concerning
all forms of beauty of man’s devising,—that, in spite of the
pains entailed in their cultivation, the fragile and conditional state
of their constitution remains: over all such things at last comes
the tread of Pan, effacing, and replacing with his own image and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
superscription, the parenthetic grace—so spiritual almost in some
of its suggestions—of the garden deity.</p>

<p>The lady of the garden, the charming sentimentalist, whom I
can only excuse for not killing the slugs and snails by believing
that she wore a crinoline and was altogether ignorant of natural
laws, harmonises exquisitely for a while with her high-clipped
hedges and garden statuary. It is an <i>ensemble</i> to gaze into as into a
picture: but the shadows of ruin and decay cross it; it is too
graceful to last. Pan is stronger than any form of beauty that
springs out of modes and fashions.</p>

<p>So, when she dies, she is but the forerunner of the death of the
whole garden: when she evaporates the <i>petite mort</i> runs through
all its bowers and alleys: its apparitions rise and follow her funeral
with a sense that their own time of dissolution approaches; and
the mode passes through a period of squalor and morbid abandonment
back into the hands of the ultimate master of things earthly.</p>

<p>It is an unpopular thing, may be, to assert that man’s sense of
beauty is so conditional to himself and the uses he makes of it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Yet here we are shown how, with war to the death, unsightly
overthrow follows his abandonment of his stolen pleasure-ground,
and wipes out his trespassing footprints.</p>

<p>Man’s sense of beauty is his own: it is not Nature’s. The aim
of all art is to restrict Nature, and teach her that her place is not
in the high places of men; and we only admire Nature because in
the present strength of our civilisation we are strong enough to
pet her. Hannibal was a better judge of the true unsightliness of
Alpine scenery than we ourselves.</p>

<p>I should have preferred to add nothing to what I have drawn:
but an explanation of my unkind view of the rival claims of Pan
and the Garden-god has been wrung from me.</p>

<p>For the present the genius of civilisation, numerating duration
into hours and years and centuries for man’s convenience, overrides
the slow-crawling tortoise of Time: but it will not always
be so; and earth will come at last to be altogether rid of us and
that superfluous “sense of beauty” which has so long yoked her
back, and hedged her wastes and furrowed her fields.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
